# task3 (HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION)
# Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

This is a simple project demonstrating linear regression using Python. We predict house prices based on features like area. The model is built using `scikit-learn`, and the data is visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Steps
1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Split into train and test sets.
3. Train a linear regression model.
4. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.
5. Plot the results.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
